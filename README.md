# Project Overview

Traditional resume screening and job recommendation systems often rely heavily on keyword matching.

For example, a resume containing the following technologies:

    React
    Node.js
    MongoDB
    Express

may be considered a strong match for a Full Stack Developer role simply because the same keywords appear in the job description.

However, keyword overlap alone does not fully capture:

- The context in which a technology was used
- The relationship between different skills
- Project experience
- Candidate strengths
- Missing skills
- Career-role suitability
- Resume completeness
- Job-description requirements
- The semantic relationship between a candidate and a job

TalentLens aims to address these limitations by combining deterministic processing with AI-powered contextual reasoning.

The current implementation primarily focuses on the Job Seeker workflow.

A job seeker can upload a resume and receive:

- Structured resume information
- Recommended career roles
- Alternative career roles
- Resume strengths
- Missing skills
- Missing resume sections
- Resume improvement suggestions
- Relevant job opportunities
- Resume-to-job matching
- Direct application links

---

# Objectives

The project has two primary objectives.

## Objective 1 — Resume Analytics and Accurate Job Recommendation

Develop a smart resume-analysis and job-recommendation system that goes beyond simple keyword matching.

The system aims to:

- Extract structured information from resumes
- Understand candidate skills and experience
- Identify suitable job roles
- Compare candidate capabilities against job requirements
- Identify skill gaps
- Provide meaningful resume improvement suggestions
- Recommend relevant job opportunities

AI-powered contextual reasoning is used to understand the semantic relationship between a candidate's resume, skills, projects, experience, and potential career roles.

---

## Objective 2 — Resume-to-Portfolio Transformation

Transform structured resume information into a meaningful digital portfolio.

The planned portfolio feature will allow a job seeker to convert their resume into a structured personal portfolio website.

The portfolio MVP is currently pending and will be implemented in a later development phase.

---

# Key Features

## 1. User Authentication

Users can register and log in securely.

The application is designed around two user roles:

- Job Seeker
- Recruiter

The current implementation focuses primarily on the Job Seeker workflow.

---

## 2. Resume Upload

Job seekers can upload their resumes through the web interface.

Supported formats include:

- PDF
- DOC
- DOCX

Uploaded files are processed by the backend before entering the resume-analysis pipeline.

---

## 3. AI Resume Analysis

Google Gemini is used for contextual reasoning over the extracted resume information.

The system can identify:

- Candidate skills
- Education
- Experience
- Projects
- Certifications
- Achievements
- Strengths
- Suitable job roles
- Alternative job roles
- Missing skills
- Missing resume sections
- Resume improvement suggestions

The AI response is normalized by the backend before being consumed by the React frontend.

This ensures that the frontend receives predictable data structures.

---

## 4. Career Role Recommendation

TalentLens identifies job roles that best align with the candidate's resume.

For example:

    Best Career Match

    Full Stack Developer

    78% Match

Alternative roles can also be suggested when sufficient information is available.

For example:

    Backend Developer
    Frontend Developer
    Software Engineer

The recommendations are generated dynamically from the candidate's resume rather than being hard-coded.

---

## 5. Skill Gap Analysis

The system identifies skills that may improve a candidate's suitability for their target roles.

For example:

    Skills to Improve

    Docker
    TypeScript
    AWS
    Automated Testing

The system attempts to distinguish between skills already demonstrated in the resume and skills that may be relevant but are missing.

---

## 6. Resume Improvement Suggestions

TalentLens can identify areas where the resume itself could be improved.

Examples include:

- Improving project descriptions
- Providing stronger evidence for technical skills
- Adding measurable outcomes
- Improving section completeness
- Making experience descriptions more specific
- Better presenting project contributions

The system avoids recommending that users simply add keywords they do not actually know.

---

## 7. Job Discovery

TalentLens can retrieve available job opportunities using external job data sources.

The current implementation uses the Jobicy public jobs API.

Job listings are normalized and displayed inside the Job Seeker dashboard.

A job may contain:

- Job title
- Company
- Location
- Job type
- Publication date
- Source
- Match score
- Matched skills
- Missing skills
- Original application URL

---

## 8. Resume-to-Job Matching

Job recommendations are not simply displayed in the order returned by the job provider.

The system attempts to compare the candidate's profile with individual job listings.

Matching can consider:

- Job title
- Candidate skills
- Job description
- Required technologies
- Role relevance
- Available job requirements

The resulting score is used to prioritize opportunities that are more relevant to the candidate.

---

## 9. India-Oriented Job Discovery

TalentLens is primarily intended for Indian students, freshers, and job seekers.

The default job-search context is therefore:

    India

rather than a specific city.

The system is designed to prioritize:

1. Jobs located in India
2. Remote jobs that accept candidates from India
3. India-eligible opportunities
4. Global opportunities when the user explicitly broadens the search

Country-restricted opportunities such as:

    United States only
    Canada only
    UK only

should not be recommended as India-focused opportunities.

---

# Architecture

TalentLens follows a separated frontend/backend architecture.

    TalentLens
    |
    +-- backend
    |     |
    |     +-- Node.js
    |     +-- Express.js
    |     +-- MongoDB
    |     +-- Gemini integration
    |     +-- Resume processing
    |     +-- Job search services
    |
    +-- frontend
          |
          +-- React
          +-- Vite
          +-- UI components

The backend follows an MVC-inspired architecture.

    Client Request
          |
          v
        Route
          |
          v
      Controller
          |
          v
       Service
          |
          +---- Database
          |
          +---- Gemini
          |
          +---- Resume Processing
          |
          +---- Job Provider
          |
          v
       Response
          |
          v
        React

This separation keeps sensitive operations and external API credentials on the backend.

# APIs and External Services

TalentLens currently uses the following external services:

| Service | Purpose | API Key Required |
|---|---|---|
| Google Gemini API | AI-powered resume reasoning and contextual analysis | Yes |
| Jobicy API | Job opportunity discovery | No API key for the current public endpoint |
| MongoDB | Persistent application data | Connection string required |

---

# Google Gemini API

Google Gemini is used for contextual AI reasoning.

The Gemini integration is handled entirely by the backend.

The API key is never exposed to the React frontend.

The general flow is:

    Resume Information
          |
          v
        Backend
          |
          v
    Google Gemini API
          |
          v
    Structured JSON
          |
          v
    Backend Validation
          |
          v
    Backend Normalization
          |
          v
        React

Gemini is used for tasks such as:

- Understanding resume context
- Identifying relevant skills
- Determining suitable career roles
- Generating contextual explanations
- Identifying skill gaps
- Generating resume improvement suggestions
- Interpreting job descriptions where appropriate

Gemini is not responsible for inventing job listings or application URLs.

Real job information comes from external job providers.

---

## Gemini API Key

A Gemini API key can be created through Google AI Studio.

Add it to the backend environment file:

    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

An optional Gemini model can also be configured:

    GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash

The backend should provide a sensible default model if `GEMINI_MODEL` is not specified.

---

# Jobicy API

TalentLens currently uses Jobicy as one of its job opportunity sources.

Jobicy provides a public remote-jobs API.

The current public endpoint does not require an API key.

The backend retrieves available listings and normalizes them before they are returned to the frontend.

The available job information may include:

- Job title
- Company
- Location
- Job type
- Description
- Publication date
- Original job URL

The original job listing URL is used for the application link.

---

## Jobicy Limitations

Jobicy is primarily a remote-jobs source and therefore does not provide comprehensive coverage of all Indian job listings.

Because of this limitation, TalentLens does not claim that Jobicy represents the complete Indian job market.

The application uses geographic filtering and ranking to prioritize India-oriented opportunities where sufficient location or eligibility information is available.

The job source is displayed to users.

Future versions can integrate additional job providers to improve India-specific coverage.

---

# Future Job Providers

The job-search architecture is designed to support multiple providers.

A future implementation may integrate additional job APIs with stronger India-specific coverage.

One possible provider is Adzuna, which provides country-specific job search APIs and supports keyword and location-based searches.

However, Adzuna requires application credentials and therefore is not required for the current basic prototype.

The intended architecture is:

    Job Search Service
          |
          +-- Jobicy Provider
          |
          +-- Adzuna Provider
          |
          +-- Future Providers

This allows additional job sources to be introduced without requiring a complete frontend rewrite.

---

# MongoDB

MongoDB is used as the primary database.

It currently supports application data such as:

- User accounts
- User roles
- Authentication-related information
- Other persistent application data

The database connection is configured through an environment variable.

Example:

    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

---

# Authentication

TalentLens uses token-based authentication.

The general authentication flow is:

    Register
       |
       v
    Securely store user credentials
       |
       v
    Login
       |
       v
    JWT issued
       |
       v
    Authenticated API requests
       |
       v
    Protected dashboard

The application is designed to support:

    Job Seeker
    Recruiter

The current implementation focuses on the Job Seeker side.

---

# Resume Analysis Pipeline

The current resume-analysis pipeline is:

    1. User uploads resume
             |
             v
    2. Multer receives the file
             |
             v
    3. Backend extracts resume text
             |
             v
    4. Resume information is processed
             |
             v
    5. Google Gemini performs contextual analysis
             |
             v
    6. Gemini returns structured analysis
             |
             v
    7. Backend validates and normalizes the response
             |
             v
    8. Career roles are identified
             |
             v
    9. Skill gaps are identified
             |
             v
    10. Resume improvement suggestions are generated
             |
             v
    11. Results are returned to React

A normalization layer is important because AI-generated output cannot be assumed to always follow the expected frontend structure.

For example, collection fields should consistently use arrays:

    skills: []
    education: []
    experience: []
    projects: []
    missingSkills: []
    missingSections: []
    improvementSuggestions: []

This prevents malformed AI responses from breaking the frontend.

---

# Job Recommendation Pipeline

The current job recommendation process is:

    Candidate Resume
          |
          v
    Best Career Role
          |
          v
    Job Search Query
          |
          v
    Job Provider
          |
          v
    Available Job Listings
          |
          v
    Normalize Job Data
          |
          v
    Compare Resume with Job
          |
          v
    Calculate Match
          |
          v
    Rank Jobs
          |
          v
    Display Recommended Opportunities
          |
          v
    Original Application Link

The objective is to make the recommendation actionable rather than simply telling a candidate:

    "You are suitable for Full Stack Development."

Instead, TalentLens aims to help the candidate discover actual opportunities corresponding to that career direction.

---

# Project Structure

---

# Environment Configuration

All sensitive credentials must remain in the backend environment.

Create:

    backend/.env

using:

    backend/.env.example

Example configuration:

    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

    JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_jwt_secret

    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

    GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash

Jobicy currently does not require an API key for the public endpoint.

---

# Environment Security

Never commit the following file to Git:

    .env

The repository should contain:

    .env.example

with placeholders only.

Example:

    MONGODB_URI=
    JWT_SECRET=
    GEMINI_API_KEY=
    GEMINI_MODEL=

Never expose the following values through frontend environment variables:

    GEMINI_API_KEY
    MONGODB_URI
    JWT_SECRET

All protected external services should be accessed from the backend.

---

# Local Setup

## 1. Clone the repository

    git clone <repository-url>
    cd TalentLens

---

## 2. Install dependencies

Install the required project dependencies.

If the root project provides the combined development command:

    npm install

Install frontend/backend dependencies as required by the current package configuration.

---

## 3. Configure environment variables

Create:

    backend/.env

using:

    backend/.env.example

Configure:

    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_jwt_secret
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
    GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash

---

## 4. Start the application

Run:

    npm run dev:full

The frontend should be available at:

    http://127.0.0.1:5173

The Express backend runs on:

    http://127.0.0.1:5000

The frontend proxies `/api` requests to the Express backend.

---

# Frontend Development

The frontend is built using React and Vite.

Typical development command:

    cd frontend
    npm run dev

The Vite development server provides hot module replacement during development.

---

# Backend Development

The backend uses Node.js and Express.

The backend is responsible for:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Database access
- Resume upload handling
- Resume processing
- Gemini communication
- Analysis normalization
- Job-provider communication
- Job matching

The React application does not directly communicate with Gemini or other protected services.

---

# API Flow

## Authentication

Typical authentication routes include:

    POST /api/auth/register
    POST /api/auth/login

Authentication middleware protects private functionality.

---

## Resume Analysis

The analysis route receives an authenticated resume upload.

The general request flow is:

    React
      |
      v
    Analysis API
      |
      v
    Authentication Middleware
      |
      v
    Multer
      |
      v
    Analysis Controller
      |
      v
    Analysis Service
      |
      v
    Gemini
      |
      v
    Normalized Result
      |
      v
    React

Exact endpoint names may evolve as the implementation develops.

---

# Frontend Flow

The Job Seeker frontend currently follows this general flow:

    Landing / Login
          |
          v
    Job Seeker Authentication
          |
          v
    Job Seeker Dashboard
          |
          v
    Resume Upload
          |
          v
    Resume Analysis
          |
          v
    Analysis Result Dashboard
          |
          +-- Best Career Match
          |
          +-- Alternative Roles
          |
          +-- Strengths
          |
          +-- Skill Gaps
          |
          +-- Resume Improvements
          |
          +-- Recommended Jobs
          |
          +-- Direct Application Links
          |
          +-- Extracted Resume Information

Sections are rendered dynamically based on available analysis data.

Empty or meaningless sections should not be displayed.

---

The portfolio MVP is expected to generate sections such as:

- About
- Skills
- Education
- Experience
- Projects
- Certifications
- Achievements
- Contact

The objective is to convert existing resume information into a presentable digital profile without requiring the user to manually build a website.

---

# Security Considerations

The application follows a backend-first approach for sensitive operations.

## API Keys

Gemini credentials remain on the backend.

## Authentication

Protected routes require authentication.

## Passwords

Passwords should never be stored in plain text.

## Environment Variables

Secrets are stored in environment variables and should never be committed to the repository.

## Resume Files

Uploaded resumes should be handled carefully and should not be exposed publicly without authorization.

## External URLs

Job application links should originate from trusted job providers or verified search URLs.

Gemini should never be trusted to generate arbitrary application URLs.

---

# Limitations

The current prototype has several limitations.

## Job Data Coverage

The current Jobicy integration is primarily oriented toward remote jobs and therefore does not provide comprehensive coverage of all Indian job listings.

Additional providers may be integrated in future versions.

---

## AI Accuracy

Gemini provides contextual reasoning but remains a probabilistic AI system.

Its output must therefore be:

- Structured
- Validated
- Normalized
- Interpreted carefully

The system does not claim that AI recommendations are perfectly accurate.

---

## Job Match Accuracy

Job matching currently depends on the quality and completeness of available resume and job information.

Future versions can improve matching through:

- Stronger semantic embeddings
- Domain-specific skill taxonomies
- Experience weighting
- Education relevance
- Location eligibility
- Better job requirement extraction
- More advanced NLP techniques

---

## Job Provider Limitations

External job APIs may have:

- Limited geographic coverage
- Limited job categories
- Delayed listings
- Rate limits
- Provider-specific restrictions

Therefore, TalentLens does not claim to represent every available job opportunity.

---

## Portfolio Generation

The resume-to-portfolio module is not yet implemented in the current version.

---

## Recruiter Module

The recruiter workflow is currently pending.

---

# Development Philosophy

TalentLens follows a hybrid approach rather than relying entirely on generative AI.

The system combines:

    Deterministic Processing
            +
    Structured Data Normalization
            +
    Rule-Based Matching
            +
    AI Contextual Reasoning
            +
    External Job Data

This approach is intended to provide greater reliability than using an LLM for every part of the system.

For example:

### Google Gemini

Used for:

- Contextual understanding
- Semantic interpretation
- Resume reasoning
- Career-role recommendations
- Skill-gap analysis
- Personalized resume suggestions

### Backend Logic

Used for:

- Validation
- Normalization
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Deterministic calculations
- Data transformation
- Job filtering
- Job ranking

### External APIs

Used for:

- Real-world job information

This separation makes the system easier to debug, maintain, and extend.

# Acknowledgements

TalentLens makes use of several technologies and services that enable the current prototype:

- React and Vite for the frontend
- Node.js and Express for the backend
- MongoDB for persistent data storage
- Multer for file uploads
- Google Gemini API for AI-powered contextual analysis
- Jobicy API for job opportunity discovery

These services are integrated into the application through the backend wherever sensitive credentials or server-side processing are required.
